# gol
Gol is a simple python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using pygame. See [Terry's blog about gol](http://terrysmusings.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/game-of-life.html) for more information.

# Run Game of Life
```
$ python gol.py
```
The game options are given on the window title.

# Initialisation Screen

+ Type a to load acorn pattern.
+ Type s to load switch engine pattern.
+ Type l to load glider pattern.
+ Type p to load rpentomino pattern.
+ Type d to load diehard pattern.

Or you can type r to create a random pattern. Or you can use the mouse to create your own.
